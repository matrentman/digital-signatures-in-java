This is a simple example of how to work with digital signatures in Java.  

First we will perform the following basic steps to create and encode a signature:
generate an RSA keypair
create the signature
encode the signature to base64

And second we will perform these basic steps to decode and verify the signature:
decode the signature from base64
verify the signature
